# higherOrderFromScratch

Whiteboard, make a code plan and build each of the following methods:

.map() - function that takes an array of items and a function that returns an array with each item manipulated by that function.

.reduce() - function that takes an array of food orders with their amounts and returns the total amount of all the food orders.

.filter() - function that takes an array of items and a function that returns an array with only the items that return true in the function.

Create a repo called "Higher-Order-From-Scratch".

OPTIONAL
Practice working from branches by creating a new branch called: "HigherOrder".
Place your code in a file called main.js.
Create a pull request (PR) for Higher-Order-From-Scratch to be merged into master.
